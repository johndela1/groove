In electronics and telecommunications, jitter is the deviation from true periodicity of a presumably periodic signal

Jitter is the variation in time delay between when a signal is transmitted and when it's received over a network connection

How is network jitter measured?
Single Endpoint

Where your network has control over just one of the endpoints (aka single-ended), jitter is determined by measuring the mean round-trip time (RTT), and the minimum RTT of a series of voice packets.
Double endpoint

In a double-ended path, the measurement used is the instantaneous jitter, or the variation between the intervals for transmitting and receiving a single packet. Jitter is the average difference between instantaneously measured jitter and the average instantaneous jitter throughout the transmission of a series of data packets.
